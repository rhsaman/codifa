"""Agent registry — opencode-style subagents.

Each agent has a name, a description (shown to the parent model so it knows
when to delegate), and a tool set. The ``task`` tool looks up an agent by
``subagent_type`` and runs it as an isolated sub-agent, exactly like opencode's
``task`` tool + agent registry (packages/opencode/src/agent/agent.ts).

The descriptions below are opencode's verbatim agent descriptions — the parent
model reads them from the ``task`` tool schema and decides which agent to
delegate to.
